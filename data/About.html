		<p>I would like to introduce myself in this section. My name is Muhammad Iqbal. My friends and family call me Iqbal, so feel free to call me same. I’m a part time student of computer science at Griffith College Dublin. I’m a web developer and this is my Client-Side Web Development project. The aim of this project is to develop a website which is responsive to different types of devices such as mobile phones, tablets and desktops. Which means, this website will fit itself to the screen size of all above devices. I must say I very much enjoyed creating this website. Im also very excited to learn even more about new features and techniques to help me create and design web projects more dynamically.</p>
		<p>I was born and raised in Saudi Arabia and went to school in Pakistan. This is where I come from. I have always had an interest in computers. Although I always wanted to upskill myself in computer sciences more and to earn the degree, after completing a formal computer education in Pakistan I decided to travel abroad and experience the life. That is how I happened to get to Ireland. I have been living in Ireland for over 11 years. I chose computer science at Griffith college because I love programming in different languages and making websites and I wish to become a full stack programmer in future. I like analyzing things and finding new innovative ways of solving problems it makes me more determined and passionate about computing. I like meeting new people and get to know different cultures, I love travelling, cooking, driving, listening to music, hiking and more spacifically I enjoy anytype of water sports. I love instrumental music and I play guitar and piano.</p>
		<p>Thanks for reading and enjoy.</p>
